## üß† How It Works

### Enhanced Deep Research Process

1. **Query & Refinement:** System generates follow-up questions to focus research
2. **Parallel Research:**
   - Web Crawling: Searches DuckDuckGo, visits websites, extracts content
   - Google Search Grounding: Accesses current information directly
3. **Iterative Exploration:** Identifies knowledge gaps and generates additional searches
4. **Results Combination:** Combines findings from both approaches for comprehensive coverage
5. **Analysis & Synthesis:** Identifies patterns, evaluates sources, synthesizes findings
6. **Report Generation:** Creates a well-structured report with proper citations

### Direct Search Process

1. **Simple Query:** Submit your research topic through a streamlined interface
2. **Google Search Grounding:** Accesses real-time information from Google Search
3. **AI-Powered Synthesis:** Processes search results while maintaining source attribution
4. **Immediate Report:** Generates a well-structured report within seconds
