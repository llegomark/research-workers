## ‚ú® Features

- **Deep Research Capabilities:** Conduct in-depth research on any topic you can imagine.
- **Powered by Google Gemini 2.0:** Leverages the advanced reasoning and language capabilities of Google's latest models
  for high-quality research reports.
- **Serverless Architecture:** Runs entirely on Cloudflare Workers and Workflows, offering scalability, reliability, and
  cost-effectiveness.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard:**  Built with Hono and JSX for a reactive and intuitive web interface to manage and view
  your researches.
- **No Prompt Compression Needed:** Takes advantage of Gemini 2.0's massive context window, simplifying the architecture
  and improving report quality.

## üöÄ Inspiration and Acknowledgements

This project is heavily inspired by the incredible work of [dzhng](https://github.com/dzhng) and
their [deep-research](https://github.com/dzhng/deep-research) project.  **A huge thank you and props to dzhng for
creating the original concept and codebase that served as the foundation for workers-research.**  This project adapts
and reimagines the core ideas of deep-research to run seamlessly within the Cloudflare ecosystem, making it more
accessible and easier to deploy.

## üí° Key Differences from Deep-Research

- **Serverless First with Cloudflare Workers:**  The original `deep-research` project is designed to run in Node.js or
  Docker environments. `workers-research` is built from the ground up for Cloudflare Workers.
- **Cloudflare Workflows for Reliability:**  A significant enhancement is the use of Cloudflare Workflows to manage the
  research process. This ensures that even complex, multi-step research tasks are reliably completed.
- **Gemini 2.0 and Simplified Architecture:**  Leveraging the extensive 2 million token context window and
  cost-effectiveness of Google Gemini 2.0, `workers-research` **omits prompt compression techniques** found in the
  original project. This simplifies the codebase, potentially improves report quality by providing more context to the
  model, and reduces complexity.
- **Low Cost Deployment:** `workers-research` is designed to be deployable on Cloudflare Workers. But due to some
  features being locked in the
  paid mode (namely browser rendering), deploying this project requires having to pay the minimum $5
  per month subscription. The included volume in your base subscription is going to cover more than 100 researches per day, without going over the $5
  a month.

## üîç Use Cases

- **Academic Research:** Quickly gather information and insights for academic papers, theses, and research projects.
- **Market Analysis:** Research industry trends, competitors, and market dynamics for business decisions.
- **Content Creation:** Generate comprehensive research for blog posts, articles, and educational content.
- **Product Development:** Explore user needs, technical solutions, and industry standards for new products.
- **Educational Projects:** Help students gather information on complex topics for projects and assignments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Cloudflare Workers:**  The core runtime environment for the application.
- **Cloudflare Workflows:**  Manages the research process, ensuring reliable execution and persistence.
- **Cloudflare D1 Database:**  Serverless SQL database to store research data, status, and results.
- **Browser Rendering:**  Web crawling API used to gather information from the internet.
- **Google Gemini 2.0:**  The cutting-edge language model from Google AI, responsible for generating research reports
  and insights.
- **Cloudflare AI Gateway:** Optional proxy for AI requests, providing caching and enhanced management capabilities.
- **Hono:**  A lightweight web framework for Cloudflare Workers, used for building the dashboard and API endpoints.
- **workers-qb:**  A lightweight query builder for Cloudflare D1, simplifying database interactions.

## üö¶ Getting Started

You have two options to get started with workers-research:

### 1. Try the Hosted Version

Visit our [hosted platform](https://rosai.dev) to start using workers-research instantly with no setup required. Free for testing and light usage.

### 2. Self-Deployment

Follow these steps to set up and run `workers-research` on your Cloudflare account:

#### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:G4brym/workers-research.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Cloudflare Login:**
   Authenticate with your Cloudflare account using Wrangler:
   ```bash
   wrangler login
   ```

4. **Create a Cloudflare D1 Database:**
   Create a D1 database in your Cloudflare dashboard or using Wrangler:
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 create workers-research
   ```
   **Important:**  Replace `"replace-me"` in your `wrangler.toml` file with the `database_id` output from the command
   above.

5. **Apply Database Migrations:**
   Apply D1 database migrations using Wrangler:
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --remote
   ```

6. **Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:**
   Deploy your worker to Cloudflare:
   ```bash
   wrangler deploy
   ```
   This will deploy your worker to `workers-research.{your-user}.workers.dev` (or your custom domain if configured).

7. **Set up API Keys:**
   - **Google AI Studio API Key:** [https://aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com).

   - Upload API Keys into workers:

     ```bash
     npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_API_KEY
     ```

8. **(Optional) Configure Cloudflare AI Gateway:**
   - Create an AI Gateway in your Cloudflare account dashboard.
   - Configure the gateway with your preferred settings.
   - Set the required environment variables:

     ```bash
     npx wrangler secret put AI_GATEWAY_NAME
     npx wrangler secret put AI_GATEWAY_ACCOUNT_ID
     ```

   - If your gateway has authentication enabled, also set the API key:

     ```bash
     npx wrangler secret put AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY
     ```

9. **Access the Dashboard:**
   Open your deployed worker URL (e.g., `https://workers-research.{your-user}.workers.dev`) in your browser to access
   the research dashboard.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Usage

1. **Create a New Research:**
   - On the dashboard homepage, you'll see a "Create New Research" section.
   - Enter your research query, desired depth, and breadth.
   - Click "Continue with creation".

2. **Answer Follow-up Questions:**
   - The application will generate follow-up questions to clarify your research intent.
   - Answer these questions to refine the research direction.
   - Click "Create new Research" to start the research workflow.

3. **Monitor Research Status:**
   - You can track the status of your researches on the dashboard.
   - Researches in progress will be marked as "Running".
   - Completed researches will be marked as "Complete".

4. **Read Research Reports:**
   - Once a research is complete, a "Read" button will appear next to it.
   - Click "Read" to view the generated research report in a nicely formatted HTML page.

5. **Re-run Researches:**
   - If you want to re-run a previous research, click the "üîÑ" button next to the research entry. This will create a new
     research based on the same query and parameters.

## üìä Performance & Limitations

- **Research Time:** Most researches complete within 5-10 minutes, depending on complexity.
- **Research Depth:** Configure depth from 1-5, with higher values producing more comprehensive reports.
- **API Limits:** Be aware of Cloudflare and Google Gemini API limits when running multiple researches.
